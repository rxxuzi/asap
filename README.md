## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Scala 3.3.1
- SBT (Scala Build Tool)
- JavaFX SDK 22.0.1 or compatible version

## Environment Setup

1. Install JDK 11 or higher
2. Install Scala 3.3.1 and SBT
3. Download and install JavaFX SDK
4. Set the `JAVAFX_HOME` environment variable to point to your JavaFX SDK directory

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rxxuzi/asap.git
   cd asap
   ```
2. Configure your SSH settings:
   - For Windows users:
     Use the provided create_ssh_config.bat script:
     ```
     create_ssh_config.bat
     ```
   - For Linux/macOS users:
     Use the provided create_ssh_config.sh script:
     ```
     chmod +x create_ssh_config.sh
     ./create_ssh_config.sh
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to enter your SSH connection details.
   - The script will generate an ssh_config.json file.

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   sbt run
   ```

## Configuration

ASAP uses JSON files for configuration. The main configuration file is typically named `asap.json`, and SSH connection details are stored in separate JSON files.

For detailed information about configuration options and file formats, please refer to the [Configuration Guide](doc/config.md).

## Usage

1. **Connect to SSH**:
   - In the Home tab, enter the path to your SSH JSON configuration file.
   - Click "Connect" to establish the SSH connection instantly.
2. **File Transfer**: Use the Send tab to upload files to the remote server.
3. **File Browsing**: Navigate remote files in the View tab.
4. **Remote Execution**: Run commands on the remote server using the Exec tab.

## Building from Source

To build ASAP from source:

```bash
sbt assembly
```

This will create a fat JAR in the `target/scala-3.3.1/` directory.
